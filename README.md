## How to use
Open the [this page in your browser](http://ionicabizau.github.io/github-profile-languages) and
write in the textbox a GitHub username you want to fetch the programming languages graph.

Wait until the data is fetched and enjoy the graph! :smile:

If you like to embed the resulted graph, just click <kbd>Embed</kbd> and copy the embed code in
your page.

Also, you can share the graph on Twitter, Facebook and Google Plus.

## How to contribute
1. File an issue in the repository, using the bug tracker, describing the
   contribution you'd like to make. This will help us to get you started on the
   right foot.
2. Fork the project in your account and create a new branch:
   `your-great-feature`.
3. Commit your changes in that branch.
4. Open a pull request, and reference the initial issue in the pull request
